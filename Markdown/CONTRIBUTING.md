## Branch Gate Strategy

NeonSpace uses a three-tier branch gate system to ensure code quality and deployment stability:

### Development Flow

**Work-in-Progress Branches**

-   Any branch outside of the 3 main branches (`dev`, `preview`, `main`) represents work-in-progress, prototypes, and ideas
-   These branches have no special meaning and are for experimentation and feature development

**dev → preview → main**

1. **dev branch** - Current Development State

    - Collects work-in-progress features from feature branches
    - Reflects the current active development state
    - All feature branches should target `dev` for pull requests

2. **preview branch** - Staging Environment

    - Takes everything from `dev` branch that has passed initial checks
    - Generates preview deployments for testing in a production-like environment
    - Acts as a staging gate before production

3. **main branch** - Production Ready
    - Receives stable changes from `preview` branch
    - Should only contain thoroughly tested, stable code
    - Triggers production deployment when all checks pass on PR merge
    - Represents the live/production state

### Deployment Pipeline

-   **dev** → CI checks only
-   **preview** → CI checks + preview deployment generation
-   **main** → CI checks + production deployment (on merge)

This ensures progressive stability validation as code moves through the development pipeline.
