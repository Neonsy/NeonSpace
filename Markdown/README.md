<!-- Note to self, don't use HTML as it's causing weird blue artifacts -->

This is my corner of the web, a personal space to collect work, write openly, and connect ideas across design and engineering.

My general goal is to create freely, share in public, and keep a living record of what I’m learning.

> [!NOTE]
> With the amount of information I consume, it will never be a complete record, but let's not talk about that 🤪

## The NeonSpace Philosophy

> "In the vast digital cosmos, every piece of knowledge is a star waiting to be connected. The most unlikely information can become the bridge to breakthrough insights."

### 🧠 The Knowledge Seeker's Approach

-   🔍 Active Learning: Constantly absorbing information from diverse sources
-   🧩 Context Building: Creating connections between seemingly unrelated concepts
-   🎯 Evaluation / Iteration: Evaluating options based on probability, while constantly mixing / mutating potentials
-   💡 Knowledge Preservation: Never dismissing information, even unlikely pieces can become valuable

### 💭 Beliefs, Values, and Practice

#### 🎯 User-Centric Development

Every decision prioritizes the human experience.
Build for people, not for corporate checkboxes or arbitrary metrics.
Technology should enhance lives.

#### 🏢 Corporate Culture vs Personal Motivation

I value user-centric design and personal motivation over corporate-driven development.
Too often projects are built to satisfy executives and shareholders, not actual users.
I focus on serving people first, not profit margins.

#### 🤝 Trusting Experts and Building Relationships

People in charge should trust their experts and build relationships with them.
Too often non-experts demand outcomes without understanding technical realities.
I believe in collaboration where expertise is respected.

#### ⚖️ Work-Life Balance and Passion

Passion should never be killed by corporate demands.
I believe in maintaining balance while staying motivated by my personal drive, not external pressure.
Quality work comes from genuine interest and sustainable practice.
Even for hobby projects, follow your interests, which are tied to your passions.
